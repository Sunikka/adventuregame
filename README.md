## Turn based roguelike RPG in typescript

I had an idea to create an adventure quest clone as a small project for my vacation to get accustomed with Node ecosystem again. (work in progress)

## Planned Tech Stack:
    - Plain HTML, CSS, JS frontend
    - TS, Express, Prisma and SQLite backend
        - Decided to try an ORM this project as well
